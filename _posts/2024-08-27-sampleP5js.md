I'm still working through the p5 tutorials. Today, I started the ["Getting Started"](https://p5js.org/tutorials/get-started/) tutorial and began producing [my second sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/wantab3/full/v6dOhU5qD).</br>
In [yesterday's blog](https://github.com/wantab3/skills-github-pages/blob/main/_posts/2024-08-26-sampleP5js.md), I mentioned needing to learn how to embed these sketches on Github pages. I haven't yet but I did find this resource that may be helpful https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Embedding-p5.js.
