I'm adding some placeholder text for now but welcome to my blog! <br/>
A note about what an index page is versus a readme: "The readme files content is repository specific and is the documentation that we want to show on github. The index file is the project documentation homepage." (via [Sarabadu](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/3110))
